# MusicHub
A desktop version control client for MusicXML.

MusicHub allows you to track your music notation files so you can compare any past versions and instantly see what changes you made. This program currently supports MusicXML which is supported by all major music notation software, including Sibelius, Finale, and MuseScore.

# Getting Started

This application uses [Electron-Forge](https://electronforge.io/) for building and packaging.

```javascript
npm install -g electron-forge
cd musichub
electron-forge start
```

# Usage
1. Install and run MusicHub. You will be prompted to set up a MusicHubScores folder.
2. Write music in your favorite music notation software and save it as uncompressed MusicXML in the MusicHubScores folder.
3. Select your file in MusicHub.
4. Save new versions of your file and compare past versions in the sidebar!
